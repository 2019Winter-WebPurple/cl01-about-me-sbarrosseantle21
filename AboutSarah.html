        <h1> Fun Facts About Me!</h1>
        <p> This is the first web page I created using brackets!</p>
        <p> I love animals, especially dogs. I have one dog, and his name is Mikey. He has been trained to be a service dog, and he has also competed in several shows in Dover.<b> He has never won first place, but he will always be first in my heart.</b> I grew up in the middle of nowhere, so I had a 'free range' type of childhood. My mom's childhood dream was to run a farm, so we always had chickens and turkeys and ducks running around the front yard. In the backyard, we used to have sheep, pigs, goats, and dairy cows, but my dad wanted horses, and we didn't have enough room for all of them. </p>
       
        <p> In adition to animals, I also love to travel. When I was litte, my parents were super busy, so I spent my summers with family friends in Hong Kong, Tokoyo, Paris, and London. Sometimes my parents would meet me wherever I was staying and take a weekend trip to somewhere new. My favorite 'weekend trip' that I ever went on was Egypt. I don't travel as much anymore, but I hope to go back to Hong Kong for college. </p>
        
        <p> When I spent my summers in London, the people I was staying with would take me to museums, because I seemed to love looking at the art. I about eight when it hit me that I could bring a notebook into the museums and try to draw my favorite pieces. The drawings never turned out well, but it really sparked my love for art. </p>
        
        <p> My favortie quote is from <i> Stranger Things:</i></p>
